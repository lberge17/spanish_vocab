Contributor's Guide

This application was originally designed for a Flatiron School coursework project. If you do feel so inspired to contribute to
this application, it is certainly welcome.

This application scrapes data from a webpage, meaning it is highly possibly the css selectors it refers to may have changed and
not been corrected in the code. Feel free to contact me or update it and submit a pull request if that is the case. Any commits
ideally should have a clear and descriptive message of all changes made.

Again, this project was created mostly for the purpose of education and preliminary learning, so any contributions should have 
this in mind. Happy coding!
