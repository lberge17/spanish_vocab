# SpanishVocab

This gem uses nokogiri to parse through spanish vocabulary words from "https://www.e-spanyol.com/basic-spanish-vocabulary.php". It then uses this data to make a CLI application where the user can view vocabulary lists by topic or test their knowledge in a given topic.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spanish_vocab'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install spanish_vocab

## Usage

Run bin/run in the terminal while in the spanish_vocab directory to open the CLI application.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
